Our milk is pure and unprocessed. As it is not pasteurized or homogenized, natural cream layers may form. This is normal and not a sign of spoilage.

Customers must store delivered milk in the refrigerator immediately. We are not responsible for spoilage caused by delayed storage or improper handling at the customer’s end.

Payments can be made monthly or weekly through UPI, cash, or online subscription platforms. Late payments may temporarily pause delivery service until dues are cleared.

Bottle security deposit is required for new customers. The deposit will be refunded when the customer returns all bottles at the end of the service period.

Complaints regarding milk quality must be raised within 4 hours of delivery. Issues reported after this period will not be eligible for replacement.

We do not provide refunds for skipped deliveries unless the customer has informed the support team in advance. Refunds for service cancellation will be processed within 3–5 working days.
