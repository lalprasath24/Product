Milk deliveries happen twice a day: morning delivery between 5:00 AM and 8:00 AM, and evening delivery between 5:00 PM and 8:00 PM. Customers must ensure someone is available to receive the bottles during the delivery window.

Glass bottles must be returned during the next delivery. Unreturned or damaged bottles may incur a replacement charge. Customers should keep empty bottles rinsed and placed outside their door before the next delivery.

Delivery schedules must be updated at least 12 hours before the next cycle. Last-minute changes may not be accepted. For vacation holds, customers should inform support in advance.

Delivery partners are instructed not to wait more than two minutes at a customer's location. If the customer is unavailable, the delivery will be marked as unsuccessful, and re-delivery may require an additional fee.

We do not deliver to restricted or unsafe zones after dark. Evening delivery times may vary depending on the area. Bad weather, road closures, and strikes may delay delivery.

Temperature-controlled boxes are used only for bulk orders. Regular home deliveries are made directly without cooling containers.
